	<h2>Terms of service</h2>
	These terms of service ("Terms", "Agreement") are an agreement between Group 20 of COM2027 (University of Surrey)
	("Group 20 of COM2027", "us", "we" or "our") and you ("User", "you" or "your"). This Agreement sets forth the
	general terms and conditions of your use of the BeechTree app or any of our products or services (collectively,
	"Websites" or "Services" or "Service" or "App").<br /><br />
	By downloading or using the app, these Terms will automatically apply to you - you should make sure therefore that
	you read them carefully before using the App. You're not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or
	our trademarks in any way. You're not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also
	shouldn't try to translate the App into other languages, or make derivative versions. The App itself, and all the
	trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Group
	20 of COM2027.<br /><br />
	Group 20 of COM2027 is committed to ensuring that the App is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason,
	we reserve the right to make changes to the App or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We
	will never charge you for the App or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you're paying
	for.<br /><br />
	The BeechTree App stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide our Service.
	It's your responsibility to keep your device and access to the App secure. We therefore recommend that you do not
	remove software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make
	your device vulnerable to malware, viruses or malicious programs, compromise your device's security features and it
	could mean that the BeechTree App won't work properly or at all.<br /><br />
	You should be aware that there are certain things that Group 20 of COM2027 will not take responsibility for. Certain
	functions of the App will require the App to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or
	provided by your mobile network provider, but Group 20 of COM2027 cannot take responsibility for the App not working
	at full functionality if you don't have access to Wi-Fi, and you don't have any of your data allowance
	left.<br /><br />
	If you're using the App outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with
	your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost
	of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the app,
	you're accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the App outside of
	your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the
	device on which you're using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill
	payer for using the App.<br /><br />
	Along the same lines, Group 20 of COM2027 cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the App i.e. You
	need to make sure that your device stays charged - if it runs out of battery and you can't turn it on to avail the
	Service, Group 20 of COM2027 cannot accept responsibility.<br /><br />
	With respect to Group 20 of COM2027's responsibility for your use of the app, when you're using the app, it's
	important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do
	rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Group 20 of COM2027
	accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this
	functionality of the App.<br /><br />
	At some point, we may wish to update the App. The App is currently available on the internet - the requirements
	for systems (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the App to) may change, and
	you'll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the App. Group 20 of COM2027 does not promise that it
	will always update the App so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the OS or browser version that you have
	installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We
	may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of
	termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you
	in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.<br />

	Occasionally there may be information on our Websites or our Services that contains typographical errors,
	inaccuracies or omissions that may relate to availability, promotions and offers. We reserve the right to correct
